# Pong_NN Trainer and Tester

## Overview

A neural network trainer for the classic Pong game, designed to develop an AI that can play Pong efficiently.
The network can be adjusted in depth and a few other variables, altering the outcome of the NN after training
Uses a custom genetic algorithm for training

There is also a program designed to allow the player to play against a generated NN to test effectiveness of the training
While not perfect the NN does perform quite well, and clearly displays that is was able to learn the game

## Features

- Train a neural network to play Pong
- Visualize training progress
- Outputs useful information of each generation to console
- Tester to play against a generated NN

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Make sure python is installed
3. Make sure numpy, termcolor, and tk are added ("pip install 'library-name'" in cmd prompt)
4. Navigate to folder containing main.py (will be Pong_NN_Tester or Pong_NN_Trainer depending on which program you are launching)
5. Right click folder and open with terminal
6. Type "python main.py"
7. Done!

## Usage

Follow installation instructions to launch program
Simply a visualization tool to see how the NN gets Trained
If you want to play against a generated NN, use Pong_NN_Tester
